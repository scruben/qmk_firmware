# Dactyl Manuform r_track

The r_track version of the Dactyl Manuform is a Dactyl Manuform with a trackball in the right thumb cluster. 
The [Dactyl-Manuform](https://github.com/tshort/dactyl-keyboard) is a split curved keyboard based on the design of [adereth dactyl](https://github.com/adereth/dactyl-keyboard) and thumb cluster design of the [manuform](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=46015.0) keyboard. The design was modified by [qurn](https://gitlab.com/qurn) to use a tracking ball in the right thumb cluster. 
Qurn also progammerd the trackball with different modes. The available trackball modes are cursor, carret, scrolling and sound/ brightness mode.

## TODO
- ~~Fix scroll/carret directions, same way as cursor~~
- Fine tune cursor, carret, scroll speeds
- ~~Check shift-carret mode for selection~~
- Investigate integration mode, add high precision mode
- ~~Change trackball modes from tap dancing to lower/raise~~
- ~~Make boot magic work for left side (no need, if matrix is not changed)~~
- ~~Define home/away, arrows (without trackball carret mode), media/brightness keys, num pad~~
- ~~({[]})~~
- ~~enter/click in raise?~~
- ~~enter with right most fingers combo~~
- ~~definetely improve left cluster conondrum raise+ctl+win~~
- ~~what to do with two bottom keys, pretty useless (combos, bspc/del), i3wm~~
- half speed for trackball
- single click btn1 better alternative to be found
- smooth scrolling if possible
- miryoku ctrl alt gui shift
- ~~one hand mouse~~
- ~~more utility to the bottom cluster buttons (appart from ctl gui spc) also enter bspc can be improved~~
- posture is far from perfect, backpain and nowhere to place hands (wrist support)
- micro scroll movements not working, maybe we need to review some thresholds?
- layer raise on right pinky, move 0 to another place?
- hide reset buttons
- make left side more stable
- miryoku... one click left mouse button, on layer change on space... special chars improvements
