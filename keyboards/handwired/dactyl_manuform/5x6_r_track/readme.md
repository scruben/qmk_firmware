# Dactyl Manuform r_track

The r_track version of the Dactyl Manuform is a Dactyl Manuform with a trackball in the right thumb cluster. 
The [Dactyl-Manuform](https://github.com/tshort/dactyl-keyboard) is a split curved keyboard based on the design of [adereth dactyl](https://github.com/adereth/dactyl-keyboard) and thumb cluster design of the [manuform](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=46015.0) keyboard. The design was modified by [qurn](https://gitlab.com/qurn) to use a tracking ball in the right thumb cluster. 
Qurn also progammerd the trackball with different modes. The available trackball modes are cursor, carret, scrolling and sound/ brightness mode.
